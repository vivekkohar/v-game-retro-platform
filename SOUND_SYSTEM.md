# Sound System Implementation

## 🔊 Sound Files Created

The game now has a complete sound system with 13 different sound effects:

### Basic Game Sounds
- **jump.wav** - Rising frequency sweep when player jumps
- **punch.wav** - Sharp tone for punch attacks
- **kick.wav** - Deeper tone for kick attacks

### Collection Sounds
- **diamond_collect.wav** - Pleasant chime when collecting regular diamonds
- **superdiamond_collect.wav** - Magical chord progression for SuperDiamonds
- **diamond_lost.wav** - Descending tone when losing diamonds

### Combat Sounds
- **robot_hit.wav** - Metallic noise when hitting robots
- **boss_hit.wav** - Deep tone when hitting bosses

### Power-Up Sounds
- **speed_boost.wav** - Rising sweep for speed power activation
- **jump_boost.wav** - Higher rising sweep for jump power activation
- **invincible.wav** - Chord progression for invincibility activation

### Game State Sounds
- **life_lost.wav** - Dramatic descending tone when losing a life
- **level_complete.wav** - Victory fanfare when completing levels

## 🎵 Sound System Features

### Dual Implementation
1. **File-based**: Loads .wav files from the `sounds/` directory
2. **Procedural**: Generates sounds in memory if files are missing
3. **Fallback**: Gracefully handles missing files or audio errors

### Sound Generation
- All sounds are mathematically generated using sine waves, frequency sweeps, and noise
- No external audio libraries required beyond pygame
- Consistent audio quality and timing

### Integration
- Sounds are triggered by game events (jumping, attacking, collecting items)
- Context-aware audio (different sounds for different situations)
- Volume-controlled and non-intrusive

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Sound Manager Class
- Handles loading, generation, and playback of all sounds
- Error handling for missing files or audio system issues
- Memory-efficient sound storage and playback

### Testing
- `test_sounds.py` - Verifies all sound files load and play correctly
- `save_sounds.py` - Regenerates sound files if needed
- Built-in error handling in the main game

## 🎮 Usage in Game

### Automatic Playback
Sounds are automatically triggered by:
- Player actions (jumping, attacking)
- Game events (collecting items, taking damage)
- Power-up activation
- Level progression

### Sound Quality
- 22.05 kHz sample rate
- 16-bit stereo audio
- Optimized for game performance
- No audio lag or delay

The sound system is now fully functional and enhances the gaming experience with appropriate audio feedback for all player actions and game events!
